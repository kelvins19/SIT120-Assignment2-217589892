                will become not transparent anymore and show a clearer background color. And also, in every page there will be a side navigation bar, that will show a menu when the user clicks on it and a login button that will redirect user to the login

                Home Page
            </li>
            <p>For the Slider in the Home Page. I am using a simple transition component from Vue.JS to control my slider. In the screenshot of the HTML Page below, we can see the code on how to implement our slider code into the HTML with the help of vue
                transition component. <br>In the CSS, we can see a little part of the screenshot on where we are using the transition component. In there, we can see that it will control on how the slider will move to another slide. <br>In the JavaScript
                page, we can see that the Vue is controlling on how the slide will be switch to another slide, when the user clicks either the next or previous button. We can see that the data that we pass here is the amount of active slide. If the active
                slide has already reached 3, the slider will not move to another slide anymore when the user clicks the next button. It also works vice versa.</p>

            <p>For the 3 boxes in the Event and Update Page. I only use HTML and CSS to control and styling it. In the HTML code, I am using table to make it looks tidier. <br>In the CSS page, We can see all the styling that been used to control the box
                container, like how it will react when the user hovers the mouse into the box. And also, how it will react when the screen becomes smaller or larger.</p>

                been used to control the box container, like how it will have a change of background into blue and change of font color into black when the user hovers the mouse into the box. And also, how it will react when the screen becomes smaller
                or larger.</p>

            <p>For the login form, we can see in the HTML code, that I am using Form Input Binding component of Vue.JS to create the login form in the login page. <br>In JavaScript code, I am using the form validation component from vuejs to validate the
                form that will be submitted by the user. In this stage, I am only make it show an alert, if the user puts no value inside the text field of the form. And also once it has been validated, it will submit the form.</p>
