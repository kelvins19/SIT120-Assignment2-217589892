        <h3>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose of this web application:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>To be a companion app with the Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield game.</li>
            <li>This web application is targeted for the player of either or both of those game.</li>
            <li>It can also be accessed by everyone, even though they are not a player of the game.</li>
            <li>User can see news of the event or update of the game.</li>
            <li>User can see the leaderboard of the global player.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>How the Web will navigate with each other page:</b></p>
        <p>From the flowchart below, we can see that each web page has menu bar, that contains all the other 5 pages links. In home page, it has a content slider that contain event, update, and leaderboard hyperlinks. In event and update page, it has three
            boxes that has description of the corresponding box, when the mouse hover to its box. In leaderboard page, there is a scrollable table, that lists all player that play the games. In login page, there is a form field that asked for username
            and password. The form will be validated first before get submitted, when the user clicks the submit button.</p>

        <h3>ISSUE OR CHALLENGE FACED:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cannot Implement Vue.JS into scrollable feature
                <p>Since week 8, I have tried many tutorial and resource to make a scrollable table by using vuejs, but none of them work. I realised if I keep doing this, my project will not complete. Therefore, I change my plan to implement the feature
                    using a simple HTML and CSS features instead using Vue.JS</p>
            </li>
            <li>Cannot put a background image
                <p>Since the first week, I started my project. I can't use an image to be my web page background. I have tried many ways and the background still a blank color. But in the week 9, I successfully implemented the background. I realised what's
                    wrong with my code. As in the CSS, i wrote the URL for the image is like this /image/IMAGE-NAME and it should be like this ../image/IMAGE-NAME </p>
            </li>
            <li>Content Slider CSS Adjustment
                <p>On the first phase of my project development, my content slider looked like a mess, as sometimes the text is disappear, the background is not showing up and many other issues. But now, after I change some variable in the CSS style of the
                    content slider, the content slider looks tidier and function as it is expected now.</p>

            <li class="list-head">
                Home Page
            </li>
            <p>In this home page, there is a slider that contain 3 slides. It also has a button to navigate through all of them. When in normal state, it will have some kind of transparent background, and when we hover our mouse through it, The slider background
                will become not transparent anymore and show a clearer background color. And also, in every page there will be a side navigation bar, that will show a menu when the user clicks on it and a login button that will redirect user to the login
                page. Below some screenshots of how the web page will look like:</p>

                the criteria of form input is fulfilled, the form will be submitted to the backend, of course if only this web apps will be connected to the backend in the future development.

                Home Page
            </li>
            <p>For the Slider in the Home Page. I am using a simple <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#ad">transition</a> component and <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/class-and-style.html#Object-Syntax">binding inline styles with object syntax</a>from
                Vue.JS to control my slider. In the screenshot of the HTML Page below, we can see the code on how to implement our slider code into the HTML with the help of vue transition component. <br>In the CSS, we can see a little part of the screenshot
                on where we are using the transition component. In there, we can see that it will control on how the slider will move to another slide. <br>In the JavaScript page, we can see that the Vue is controlling on how the slide will be switch
                to another slide, when the user clicks either the next or previous button. We can see that the data that we pass here is the amount of active slide. If the active slide has already reached 3, the slider will not move to another slide anymore
                when the user clicks the next button. It also works vice versa.</p>

            <p>For the 3 boxes in the Event and Update Page. I only use HTML and CSS to control and styling it. In the HTML code, I am using table to make it looks tidier. <br>In the CSS page, We can see all the styling that been used to control the box
                container, like how it will react when the user hovers the mouse into the box. And also, how it will react when the screen becomes smaller or larger.</p>

            <p>For the Leaderboard table, I also only use HTML and CSS to create it. In the HTML code, I am using a table to create a table with 3 columns and 30 rows that contains 30 rows of static data. <br>In the CSS page, We can see all the styling that
                been used to control the box container, like how it will have a change of background into blue and change of font color into black when the user hovers the mouse into the box. And also, how it will react when the screen becomes smaller

            <p>For the login form, we can see in the HTML code, that I am using <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html#ad">Form Input Binding</a> component of Vue.JS to create the login form in the login page. <br>In JavaScript code, I am using the
                <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/form-validation.html#ad">form validation</a> component from vuejs to validate the form that will be submitted by the user. In this stage, I am only make it show an alert, if the user puts no value
                inside the text field of the form. And also once it has been validated, it will submit the form.</p>

            </li>
            <p>For side navigation menu, In the CSS code, we can see the styling for the menu button. Like, it has to stay in the left hand side of the page, the position of the button is fixed, so it cannot move anywhere, how it will open the menu when
                the user clicks the menu button and how the menu will look like in the smaller screen. <br>On how to control the button, I am using a simple javascript code to control it. In the JavaScript code, we can see that it controls when it opens
                and when it closes. When it opens, the width of the menu will increase from 0 to 250px and when it closes, the width of the menu will come back to 0px. </p>
